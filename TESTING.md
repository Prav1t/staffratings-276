## Testing Approach

I used a mix of slice and integration tests as per asked for in the assignment:

- Validation tests: JUnit + Jakarta Validation to confirm invalid email, out-of-range scores, and missing required fields are rejected.
- Persistence tests: @DataJpaTest using an embedded H2 database to verify saving/retrieving works and delete removes entries.
- Web/controller tests: @SpringBootTest + @AutoConfigureMockMvc integration tests.

I also used integration style controller tests to avoid Mockito/ByteBuddy compatibility issues with Java 25.

## How to test

To Run all tests

From the project root:

./mvnw test
